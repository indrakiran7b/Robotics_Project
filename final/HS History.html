        <h2 class="subheading">History</h2>
        <p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century and continued through the 19th century, 
            brought about significant changes in the way goods were produced and the way people lived and worked.
             While the Industrial Revolution brought about many positive changes, such as increased productivity and
              economic growth, it also had a significant impact on working-class families, particularly in terms of their
               living conditions, health, and family life. One of the most significant impacts of the Industrial Revolution 
               on working-class families was the change in their living conditions. With the growth of factories and the 
               concentration of workers in urban areas, working-class families were forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions.
                Many families were forced to live in tenements, which were often overcrowded and lacked basic amenities such as running water
                 and sanitation facilities. These living conditions led to the spread of diseases such as cholera and typhus, which often led to
                  high mortality rates among working-class families.In addition to the poor living conditions, working-class families also had to
                   deal with long working hours and low wages. Many factory workers had to work 12-14 hour days, six days a week, just to make ends meet.
                    This left little time for family life, and many working-class families were forced to rely on older children to help support the family, 
                    which often meant taking them out of school.In conclusion, the Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on working-class families, both positive and negative. 
                    While it brought about many positive changes, such as increased productivity and economic growth, it also led to poor living conditions, 
                    long working hours, low wages, and health problems for many working-class families. Despite these challenges, many working-class families
                     were able to adapt and thrive, and the legacy of the Industrial Revolution continues to shape our world today.</p>
